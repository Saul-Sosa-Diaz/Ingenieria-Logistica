    "# Uncapacitated Multiple Allocation HLP Problem.\n",
    "### Autor: Saúl Sosa Díaz\n",

    "## El problema.\n",
    "El Problema de Ubicación de Concentradores de Múltiple Asignación Sin Capacidad (UMAHLP), un tema vital en la investigación de operativa, involucra la determinación estratégica de la ubicación óptima de concentradores (hubs) y la asignación eficiente de nodos a estos puntos. En el UMAHLP, el objetivo principal es seleccionar concentradores de una lista de ubicaciones potenciales, asignando cada nodo no concentrador a uno o más de estos hubs. El fin es minimizar el costo total, que generalmente abarca el transporte entre nodos y concentradores, y en ocasiones, los costos operativos de los hubs. A diferencia de otros desafíos en la ubicación de concentradores, el UMAHLP se distingue por no tener restricciones de capacidad, permitiendo que cada concentrador maneje cualquier volumen de tráfico o demanda. Además, la característica de múltiple asignación permite que un nodo se asocie con más de un concentrador, incrementando la flexibilidad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consideremos un conjunto de nodos $ V$ y un número $ p$ de hubs por abrir en un grafo completo $ G=(V,A)$, donde $ |V|=n$. La cantidad de producto transportado del nodo $ i \\in V$ al nodo $ j \\in V$ se define como $ d_{ij}$. El costo unitario de transporte a lo largo del arco $ (i,j) \\in A$ se representa por $ c_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para modelar el costo de transporte, se introducen los siguientes factores, dependiendo del tipo de arco $ (i,j)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Un factor de descuento $ \\alpha$, donde $ 0 \\le \\alpha \\le 1$, se aplica cuando el arco conecta dos hubs.\n",
    "* Un factor de recolección $ \\chi$, con $ \\chi > \\alpha$, se utiliza cuando el arco va de un nodo origen a un hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tras establecer claramente el problema, estamos listos para abordar la construcción del modelo matemático.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables**\n",
    " \n",
    " * $z_{ij}$ es 1 si el nodo $i\\in V$ es asignado al hub $j\\in V$ y 0 en otro caso. Si los índices coinciden de tal manera que $z_{jj}$, la variable toma el valor de 1 si se abre un hub en $j\\in V$, y 0 en otro caso.\n",
    " * $X_{ijkm}$ es una variable continua que representa la fracción de la demanda $w_{ij}$ que se envía de $i$ a $j$ a través de los hubs $k$ y $m$. \n",
    " * $g_{ijkm} = d_{ij}(\\chi c_{ik} + \\alpha c_{km} + \\delta c_{mj} ) $, que representa el coste total del producto enviado desde $i$ a $j$ que pasa por las oficinas $k$ y $m$.\n",
